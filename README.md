## Introduction
CaRPG is an in-car RPG game designed for interactive smart window. Users can choose their favorite theme of story to play with, and the players' behaviors/choices during the game will affect the storyâ€™s direction. Sometimes players may encounter battles, they need to shoot all the monsters and beat them to win the fight. There might also be some random events when the camera catches something unusual (e.g. a monkey), the element the camera caught would then join the story and make it more immersive.
